            <p>
                Wildfires continue to cause widespread destruction in the Sonoma Valley
                and Napa Valley areas of California.  Hot, dry conditions, high winds,
                and lack of water in the area continue to hamper firefighter efforts in
                fighting these fires. Thousands of structures have been burned and stark
                landscapes show acres of standing fireplaces as the only structures that
                survived the fires that spread through neighborhoods.
